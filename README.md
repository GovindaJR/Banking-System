# QT-App
A GUI Application built with the QT framework that implements OOP concepts learning in Programming II and a SQLite database. 

# OOP Concepts
The following concepts are implemented in this project:
* [x] Design and implement a class.
* [x] Use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.
* [ ] Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch. 
* [ ] Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype). 
* [ ] Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.
* [ ] Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as arguments. 
* [ ] Follow best practices for style and readability.
* [ ] Follow best practices for documentation.
